# RAWIG

gorogue is planned as architecture, ready to modify and expand. It won't be tutorial material nor full game.  
Currently, gorogue is in early stage of development.

### Prerequisites

To work with RAWIG, you need:  
 - Go compiler  
 - C compiler  
 - BearLibTerminal library  

### Usage

RAWIG is standalone application, not a library. You can modify files and compile project by `go build` in root.

### Roadmap

RAWIG is small, personal project, and doesn't have proper, detailed roadmap. However, TODO list is maintained.

Every revision before v 0.1 is potentially unstable. 

**0.2**  
- menuses (inventory, character screen)  
- message log  
- objects (elements of dungeon, consumables, equipment)  

**0.3**  
- [l]ooking command  
- ranged combat  

### Influences

RAWIG is built from scratch. Yet, due historical reasons, it is influenced by Jotaf's roguebasin python+libtcod tutorial. It's fair to give him a credit here.
